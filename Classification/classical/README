all_bootstrap_resamples.R:
Script that calculates various metrics for the binomial comparisons - "brcaMatchedTN","ERpn","kirckirp","luadlusc", for each of the generated bootstrap resamples.
Output metrics are saved to "*multirun_save.RDS"

lum_ab_bootstrap_resamples.R
Script that calculates various metrics for the LumA vs. LumB binomial comparison, for each of the generated bootstrap resamples.
Output metrics are saved to "*multirun_save.RDS"

lumAB_alldata_multirun_44genes.R
Script to run classical classification algorithms on top 44 genes of PC1 for LumA vs. LumB binomial comparison.
